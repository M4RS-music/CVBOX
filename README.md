# CVBOX
A control voltage generator for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

# About
Modular synthesis is an addiction, lets face it. And it's probably more expensive than most... Constantly spending money on expensive modules that quite frankly, don't do all that much is a big part of this hobby. With a little bit of luck, CVBOX will one day replace many of these expensive modules (or at least work as a substitue till you can afford a dedicated unit). CVBOX will hopefully be capable of outputting any CV signal you want, with sequencers, low frequency oscilators, randomizers and much more built in. It is also planned to be able to take CV in and process it and function as a USB Midi device so you can controll with your favorite DAW (so long as that's Ableton). 

CVBOX is just an idea, for now. However it shouldn't be long before preliminary versions of it are released here so be sure to watch this repository if this sounds like something you want to play with.
